Copy-Lang
=========

Copy Lang copies language variables from one language pack to another. 

You can select the original language pack and this extension will only create languages variables used in the original pack. It will also only create the files used in the original pack. The variables from the "copy from" language pack will be substituded in the newly created language pack. Packs are used and saved in the store folder.
Especially for changed language files.
